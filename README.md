# Multiple-Linear-Regression
If you have three feature variables, or may be 10 or 100? Building a separate model for each of them, combining them, and then understanding them will be a very difficult and next to impossible task. By using multiple linear regression, you can build models between a response variable and many feature variables.
## Step_1 : Importing and Understanding Data
###  Importing the file
### Looking at the first five rows
### Looking at the last five rows
### What type of values are stored in the columns?
### Let's look at some statistical information about our dataframe.
## Step_2: Visualising Data
### Let's plot a pair plot of all variables in our dataframe
### Visualise the relationship between the features and the response using scatterplots
## Step_3: Splitting the Data for Training and Testing
### Putting feature variable to X
### Putting response variable to y
### random_state is the seed used by the random number generator. It can be any integer.
## Step_4 : Performing Linear Regression
### Representing LinearRegression as lr(Creating LinearRegression Object)
### fit the model to the training data
## Step_5 : Model Evaluation
### print the intercept
### Let's see the coefficient
## Step_6 : Predictions
### Making predictions using the model
## Step_7: Calculating Error Terms
### Checking for P-value Using STATSMODELS
## Step_8 : Implementing the results and running the model again
### Removing Newspaper from our dataset
### Model building
### Making predictions
### Plotting
